## Non-Differentiallity Sensitivity Test

Welcome to the NonDifferentialityTest repository. Here, you will find

* code to run a novel test designed to detect non-differential sensitivity of an indicator
* code to run a simulation to assess power of the test
* simulation results for sone specified scenarios (in the Shinity Ap).

## Shiny App

Our test has been applied across various scenarios, and we developed a Shiny app that visually presents the outcomes of these simulation studies for each scenario we investigated. You can access the app via the following link:

Feel free to explore the app and delve into the details of our simulation studies and their results!
